My personal website.
## Activity Log
**01/08/2025** Today I created a new GitHub account to host my personal website repository. I used [this tutorial](https://pittcs.wiki/skills/personal-website/) to make a basic HTML welcome page. I also used [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) as an intro to using GitHub Pages.

**01/09/2025** Today I cloned my repository in Visual Studio using [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git). I also had to switch my GitHub account in VS Code (initially committed through my first account). Today I mainly worked on the header and navigation part of the website. 
Below are some colors I might use on my website (courtesy of [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/fe5d26-c1dbb3-7ebc89)):
- Giants orange: fe5d26
- Tea green: c1dbb3
- Emerald: 7ebc89

**01/10/2025** I did not do very much work today. I mainly added basic information to my About Me. Tomorrow I plan to add sections about my interests and adjust the links in the footer to be attached to logos.

**01/14/2025** I worked on the section of the website describing my interests.

I also added icons for the footer links. The icons are from a [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/) kit.
