My personal website.
## Activity Log
**01/08/2025** Today I created a new GitHub account to host my personal website repository. I used [this tutorial](https://pittcs.wiki/skills/personal-website/) to make a basic HTML welcome page. I also used [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) as an intro to using GitHub Pages.

**01/09/2025** Today I cloned by repository in Visual Studio using [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git). I also had to switch my GitHub account in VS Code (initially committed through my first account). Today I mainly worked on the header part of the website. 
Below are some colors I plan to use on my website (courtesy of coolors.co):
- Giants orange: fe5d26
- Tea green: c1dbb3
- Emerald: 7ebc89
